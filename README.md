# INTERNPE_BREAST_CANCER_DETECTION
This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression to detect breast cancer from the Breast Cancer dataset provided by sklearn.
The dataset includes features like tumor radius, texture, and smoothness to classify tumors as either malignant (0) or benign (1).
The model is trained, evaluated, and visualized using:
->Confusion Matrix (Heatmap)
->Accuracy vs Test Size (Line plot)
->Tumor Distribution (Bar chart)
Let's have a look how i achieved it using following Dependencies:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
